I am a final year computer science UG student at [IIIT Delhi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/) and an undergraduate researcher at [Living Lab @ IIITD](https://livinglab.iiitd.edu.in/). My research interests lie in the area of Human-centered Design and ICT for Global Development. 

More specifically, I am interested in applying human-centred designing to develop technological solutions for people belonging to lower socio-economic strata of the society, that can impact their lives positively. Apart from this, I am also passionate about mobile application development.


I am currently trying to understand people's perception towards risk of air pollution in Delhi as a part of my undergraduate thesis and have previously interned at [Royal Bank of Scotland](https://www.rbs.com/), [IIIT Delhi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/), and [Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Government of India](https://jalshakti-ddws.gov.in/).
